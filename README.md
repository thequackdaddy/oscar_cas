Read from OSCAR system

## Goals:

- Perform authentication via stored cookie, after login
- Access pages via URL
- Get list of valid candidate numbers
- Get scored candidate numbers and scores
- Get reason codes for each candidate
- Perform basic autoscoring where possible and either note results or directly change score

## Notes:

1) The OSCAR system allows you to type into cells and use cell auditing, but does not save information.  Use the notes and evidence feature to save instead.
